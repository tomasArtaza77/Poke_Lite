                        Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) 
                        is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company,
                        a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
                        The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, 
                        and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". 
                        In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon 
                        to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise 
                        are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is 
                        "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!". There are currently 901 Pokémon species.
